    Function that converts hospital data into rates.  Takes hospital data in
    count space, at the baby Sequelae level, computes cause fractions, attaches
    the hospital utilization envelope, and multiplies the envelope and the cause
    fractions.  Data that represents fully covered populations are not made into
    cause fractions, nor is the envelope applied.  Instead, their counts are
    divided by population. Returns a DataFrame that is in Rate spaces at the
    Baby Sequelae level.

    Arguments:
        df (DataFrame) contains hospital inpatient primary diagnosis that
            has been mapped to Baby Sequelae
        return_only_inj (bool):
            switch that will make it so this function only returns injuries
            data. should always be off, it's just there for
            testing/convienience.
        apply_age_sex_restrictions (bool): switch that if True, will apply
            age and sex restrictions as determined by cause_set_id=9.  Defaults
            to true.  Useful if you want to look at data all the data that was
            present in the source.
        want_to_drop_data (bool): If True will run drop_data(verbose=False)
            from the hosp_prep module
        create_hosp_denom (bool): If true create_cause_fraction() will write
            the denominator for use later for imputed zeros.
