# diagnostic crosswalks - notes



#order of operations:
#1. run logit_kk3
#2. run logit_hema
#3. run logit_japon
#4. use run_logit_kk3 code at the very end to bind these 3 datasets together

#this final dataset gets fed into the agesplit code 

# if log transforamtion code is needed, that currently lives in my H drive/crosswalks
