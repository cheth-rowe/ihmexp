Dalynating and Burdenating in Python
=========================================================

This package currently has three goals:

#. Compute DALYs from YLLs and YLDs
#. Compute "Attributable Burdens" for YLL's, YLD's, and Deaths
#. Be an example of the current code patterns for the central computing machinery in GBD

Goal #3 implies that this package must be refactored every time that we improve the GBD machinery.
